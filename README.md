## Description
The goal of this project is to design a cost-effective intelligent toy that captures the process of logical statements.
This project currently uses an Arduino Nano and several RGB LEDs in each track for both delivery and deployment.

## History
The initial work on the project was done during Summer 2020, utilizing Git to maintain the files needed to develop this project.

## Issues 
- Supplying power from one track to the other.
- Sending data from one track to the other with hard contact (without the use of wireless or bluetooth connection).

## 1 Overview
FloTracks is an affordable intelligent toy that teaches children the fundamentals of flowchart design.
